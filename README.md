# Image Augmentation with Recognition

This repository demonstrates a Python-based approach to perform image augmentation and recognition. The project uses libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for processing and recognizing images.

## Features

- Perform various image augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, scaling, etc.
- Use machine learning models for recognizing augmented images.
- Easy-to-understand implementation with examples.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aaronx1276/Image-Augmentation-with-Recognition.git
   cd Image-Augmentation-with-Recognition
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install 
   ```

## Usage
1. Add your dataset of images to the data folder.
2. Run the augmentation script to preprocess images:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install scikit-learn
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Train the recognition model using:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. Test the model using:
   ```
   python test_model.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- augment_images.py - Script for performing image augmentations.
- train_model.py - Script for training the recognition model.
- test_model.py - Script for testing the model.
- requirements.txt - List of required Python libraries.
